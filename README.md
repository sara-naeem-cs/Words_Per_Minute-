# Words_Per_Minute-
This program gives the user text to type out and returns the user's typing speed in the form of their WPM (words per minute). 

A Java program that counts down (ie it goes 3, 2, 1 each timed for 1 second) then randomly generates text for user to type. Then it takes in user input 
(i.e. the user's typed text) and times how long it takes for them to respond. The program then returns the person's WPM (words per minute) or 
returns an error message if the text from the user doesn't match the text given by the program.
At this point the user has the option of typing a new set of words or exiting the program.
